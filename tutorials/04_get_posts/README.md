# Get post list with selected filter and tag

Tutorial pulls a list of the posts from the blockchain with selected filter and tag then displays output.

This tutorial will explain and show you how to access the **Steem** blockchain using the [steem-python](https://github.com/steemit/steem-python) library to fetch list of posts filtered by a _filter_ and _tag_

## Intro

In Steem there are built-in filters `trending`, `hot`, `created`, `promoted` etc. which helps us to get list of posts. `get_discussions_by_trending(query)`, `get_discussions_by_hot(query)`, `get_discussions_by_created(query)`, etc. functions are built-in in official library `steem-python` that we are going to use throughout all Python tutorials. 


## Steps

1.  [**App setup**](#app-setup) - Library install and import
1.  [**Filters list**](#filters-list) - List of filters to select from
1.  [**Query details**](#query-details) - Form a query
1.  [**Print output**](#print-output) - Print results in output

#### 1. App setup <a name="app-setup"></a>

In this tutorial we use 3 packages, `pick` - helps us to select filter interactively. `steem` - steem-python library, interaction with Blockchain. `pprint` - print results in better format.

First we import all three library and initialize Steem class

```python
    import pprint
    from pick import pick
    # initialize Steem class
    from steem import Steem

    s = Steem()
```

#### 2. Filters list <a name="filters-list"></a>

Next we will make list of filters and setup `pick` properly.

```python
    title = 'Please choose filter: '
    #filters list
    options = ['trending', 'hot', 'created', 'promoted']
    # get index and selected filter name
    option, index = pick(options, title)
```

This will show us list of filters to select in terminal/command prompt. And after selection we will get index and filter name to `index` and `option` variables.

#### 3. Query details <a name="query-details"></a>

Next we will form a query. In Steem, 

*   You can add a tag to filter the posts that you receive from the server
*   You can also limit the amount of results you would like to receive from the query

```python
query = {
    "limit":2, #number of posts
    "tag":"" #tag of posts
    }
#post list for selected query
posts = {0: s.get_discussions_by_trending(query),
         1: s.get_discussions_by_hot(query),
         2: s.get_discussions_by_created(query),
         3: s.get_discussions_by_promoted(query)
}
```

Above code shows example of query and simple list of function that will fetch post list with user selected filter.

#### 4. Print output <a name="print-output"></a>

Next, we will print result, post list and selected filter name.

```python
    # print post list for selected filter
    pprint.pprint(posts[index])
    pprint.pprint("Selected: "+option)
```

The example of result returned from the service is a `JSON` object with the following properties:

    }

'Selected: hot'
```

From this result you have access to everything associated to the posts including additional metadata which is a `JSON` string (that must be decoded to use), `active_votes` info, post title, body, etc. details that can be used in further development of application with Python.

That's it!
